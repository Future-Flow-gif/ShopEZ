Customer Problem Statement Template:
Problem Statement -1:  In today’s digital era, customers prefer online shopping for convenience, variety, and time-saving benefits. However, many small and medium businesses lack a centralized and efficient digital platform to manage products, customer orders, and inventory.
Traditional shopping methods do not provide easy product comparison, stock visibility, and seamless checkout experiences. Similarly, administrators struggle with manual inventory tracking and order management.
Therefore, there is a need for a secure, scalable, and user-friendly multi-category e-commerce platform that simplifies online shopping while providing efficient administrative control.
